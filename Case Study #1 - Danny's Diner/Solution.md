### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

````sql
select customer_id, sum(price)
from sales s
left join menu m on
s.product_id = m.product_id
group by customer_id
order by customer_id
````

#### Steps:
- First define tables involved:
  - `Sales` for list of customers and what has been sold
  - `Menu` for prices of the items
- Column `product_id` should be used to **join** those tables
- **GROUP BY** should be used on `customer_id`, as we want summary by the customer, in combination with **SUM** on `price`
