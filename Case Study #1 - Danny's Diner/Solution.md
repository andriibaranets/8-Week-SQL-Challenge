### **1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

#### **Solution**:
````sql
select customer_id, sum(price) as "Total amount"
from sales s
left join menu m on
s.product_id = m.product_id
group by customer_id
order by customer_id
````

#### **Steps**:
- First define tables involved:
  - `Sales` for list of customers and what has been sold
  - `Menu` for prices of the items
- Column `product_id` should be used to **join** those tables
- **GROUP BY** should be used on `customer_id`, as we want summary by the customer, in combination with **SUM** on `price`
- Adding **ORDER BY** just for better readability

### **2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

#### **Solution**:
````sql
select customer_id, count(distinct(order_date)) as "Total visits"
from sales
group by customer_id
````

#### **Steps**:
- Translating request into data requirement, we want to see on how many **distinct** dates each customer has made a purchase
- Base table is `sales`, as customer and date info is located there
- **GROUP BY** should be used on `customer_id`, as we want list of customers
- **COUNT** in combination with **DISTINCT** should be used on `order_date` to get list of distinct dates on which purchases have been made

### **3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

#### **Solution**:
````sql
with ranking as 
(
	select customer_id,
	product_name,
	rank() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date) as ranking
	from sales s 
	left join menu m
	on s.product_id = m.product_id
)
select customer_id,
product_name
from ranking
where ranking = 1
group by 1,2
````

#### Steps:
- Window function **RANK** with **PARTITION BY** `customer_id` and **ORDER BY** `order date` will provide us with the order in which products have been purchased by each clients
- To make result readable, **JOIN** is done with `menu` to get `product_name`
- All that is left is to select only rank 1 by using **WHERE** and **GROUP BY** `customer_id` and `product_name` to remove repeating purchases of the same product
- As **WHERE** and **GROUP BY** are applied before the window functions, ranking table should be prepared first and then filered and grouped. IT is done by using **WITH** and creating remporary table `ranking`
