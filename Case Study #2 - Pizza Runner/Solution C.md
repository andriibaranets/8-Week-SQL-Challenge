### **1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?**

#### **Solution**:
````sql
with recipe as 
(
	select 
		pizza_id,
		trim(unnest(string_to_array(toppings,','))) as toppings
	from pizza_runner.pizza_recipes
)
select 
	pizza_name,
	topping_name
from pizza_runner.pizza_names n
left join recipe r on
	n.pizza_id = r.pizza_id
left join pizza_runner.pizza_toppings t on
	t.topping_id::text = r.toppings
````

#### **Steps**:
- First, let's prepare data in `pizza_recipes` for usage, as currently ingridients are listed in on row, separated with a coma. <br>
For this we'll use **STRING_TO_ARRAY** in combination with **UNNEST** to transform list of items into several rows. <br> **TRIM** will remove any leading/trailing zeros.
- After that it's question of **JOINING** `pizza_names` with `pizza_toppings` through temporary `recipe` that has been just created and showing list of `topping_name` correlating to each `pizza_name`

### **2. What was the most commonly added extra?**

#### **Solution**:
````sql
with extras as
(
	select 
		order_id,
		trim(unnest(string_to_array(extras,','))) as extras
	from pizza_runner.customer_orders
	where extras is not null and extras <> ' '
)
select 
	topping_name as extra_name,
	count(order_id) as order_qty
from extras e
left join pizza_runner.pizza_toppings t on
	t.topping_id::text = e.extras
group by extra_name
order by order_qty DESC
````

#### **Steps**:
- Information on toppings used is located in `customer_orders`, column `extras`, listed as a string of numbers.
- First we'll do the same **STRING_TO_ARRAY** and **UNNEST** combinationj of actions as in previous question. This gives us temporary `extras` where each row is one instance of extra being ordered.
- Next **LEFT JOIN** `extras` with `pizza_toppings` on `topping_id` to get `topping_name` for each extra.
- If we **GROUP_BY** results by `topping_name` and **COUNT** linesm we'll get quantity of orders where extra has been ordered. Bacon is the most popular extra with it eing ordered 4 times.

### **3. What was the most common exclusion?**

#### **Solution**:
````sql
with exclusions as
(
	select 
		order_id,
		trim(unnest(string_to_array(exclusions,','))) as exclusions
	from pizza_runner.customer_orders
	where exclusions is not null and exclusions <> ' '
)
select 
	topping_name as exclusion_name,
	count(order_id) as order_qty
from exclusions e
left join pizza_runner.pizza_toppings t on
	t.topping_id::text = e.exclusions
group by exclusion_name
order by order_qty DESC
````

#### **Steps**:
- As data on exclusions is stored the same way as on extras (`customer_orders`, listed as string of numbers), solution is the same as previous question with column name replacements.
- The most picked exclusion is Cheese with 4 orders.

### **4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:**
`Meat Lovers` <br>
`Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef`<br>
`Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon` <br>
`Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers`

#### **Solution**:
````sql
ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.customer_orders ADD id serial primary key;

with 
exclusions as
(
	select 
		id,
		order_id,
		trim(unnest(string_to_array(exclusions,','))) as exclusions
	from pizza_runner.customer_orders
	where exclusions is not null and exclusions <> ' '
),
exclusions_name as
(
	select 
		id,
		order_id,
		trim(unnest(string_to_array(exclusions,','))) as exclusions,
		topping_name
	from exclusions
	left join pizza_runner.pizza_toppings t on
	t.topping_id::text = exclusions
),
extras  as
(
	select 
		id,
		order_id,
		trim(unnest(string_to_array(extras ,','))) as extras 
	from pizza_runner.customer_orders
	where extras  is not null and extras  <> ' '
),
extras_name as
(
	select 
		id,
		order_id,
		trim(unnest(string_to_array(extras,','))) as extras ,
		topping_name
	from extras 
	left join pizza_runner.pizza_toppings t on
	t.topping_id::text = extras 
),

adding_exclusions as 
(
	select 
		o.id,
		o.order_id,
		CONCAT(
			n.pizza_name,
			case 
				when e.id is NULL then ''
				else CONCAT(' - Exclude ', string_agg(e.topping_name, ', ') )
			END
		) as record
	from pizza_runner.customer_orders o
	left join pizza_runner.pizza_names n on o.pizza_id = n.pizza_id
	left join exclusions_name e on o.id = e.id
	group by o.id,o.order_id,n.pizza_name,e.id 
),

adding_extras as

(
	select 
		a.id,
		a.order_id,
		CONCAT(
			a.record,
			case 
				when e.id is NULL then ''
				else CONCAT(' - Extras ', string_agg(e.topping_name, ', ') )
			END
		) as record
	from adding_exclusions a
	left join extras_name e on a.id = e.id
	GROUP BY a.id, a.order_id,a.record, e.id
)

select * from adding_extras
````

#### **Steps**:
- We need to generate table where each row is `pizza_name` ordered with names of exclusions and extras, if there were any.
- First, let's add ID column to `customer_orders`, as we'll need to keep track which extras and inclusions are needed for each pizza. It can be done by **ALTER TABLE** and adding a new column (with type `serial` in case for PostgreSQL)
- This question will require use of CTE, as we'll need to transfor and re-combine data before presenting it
- First, using the same logic as in previous 2 questions, we create `extras_name` and `exclusions_name` temporary tables with list of extras and exclusions tied to unique ID from `customer_orders`
- Then we start with list of `ID` and `order_id` and add `exclusions_name` to it. Using **STRING_AGG**, we convert column `topping_name` into string in needed format.
- Same is repeated in `adding_extras`, but for extras
- As a result we get table with `order_id` and corresponding `record` that has been requested
